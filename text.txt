My dear brothers and sisters, we are gathered together as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to worship our Heavenly Father. We have come from all parts of this great earth where there is no need for language barriers because God has blessed us with His Spirit that He might teach each one of us individually according to his or her needs.

I am grateful for my membership in the Lord’s restored Church. I know it is true! It was brought back by Joseph Smith through divine inspiration given him by revelation. This knowledge gives me strength during difficult times when life seems unfair and unkind.

During my early years growing up in Brazil, I learned about faith at home. My parents were faithful members of the Church who loved their children and taught them what they knew. They also taught us how important it was to pray daily and read the scriptures so that we could learn more about the Savior and develop greater faith.

As a young boy living in Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil, I had many opportunities to exercise my faith. One such experience happened while playing soccer (football) near our house. A friend invited me to play with some older boys whose team needed an extra player. When the game started, everyone seemed bigger than me—except for one little guy who looked just like me!

We played hard until halftime came around. As players rested, someone asked if anyone wanted to be traded to another team. That same little guy spoke up: “If you trade me out, please don’t send me to [Soares]’s side!” Everyone laughed, but then he said something that changed everything. With tears streaming down his face, he pleaded, “Please do not let me go over to that side; those guys will eat me alive!”

I felt terrible hearing these words coming from a teammate. But before I could say anything, the coach shouted across the field, “How would you feel being part of a team without your best player?”

That comment made sense to me since I considered myself one of the worst players on any team. Still, I couldn't help thinking about poor little Pedro, whom everybody called Pepe. And even though he wasn’t very good either, he tried harder than most people did. In fact, sometimes I thought he worked too hard—and maybe that's why nobody liked him much. Anyway, after listening carefully to both sides argue back-and-forth about whether or not they should keep Pepe on their team, finally somebody decided enough talking had been done already. Then suddenly everyone began cheering loudly, saying things like:

“Yeah! Keep Pepe here.”

“We can use him better than anybody else!”

“I’m glad we’re keeping Pepe!”

And soon afterward, Pepe himself got excited again and ran off toward midfield shouting happily into space, “Hey, look—I'm still here!” To which several other kids replied sarcastically, “Oh yeah? Well…good luck!”

But despite losing the first half 4–0, somehow our team managed to win the second period 5–1 thanks largely due to having Pepe on board once more. Afterward, however, there weren’t many high fives going around amongst teammates anymore—at least among certain individuals anyway…

Later that evening, while lying awake trying unsuccessfully to fall asleep, images kept flashing through my mind of today’s events. Eventually, sleep won out eventually, allowing me time alone within darkness itself—a place filled only with memories, dreams, fears, hopes, regrets, joys, sorrows—all mixed together forming one big jumbled mess inside my head. At last, exhaustion took hold, causing me to drift away slowly towards oblivion...

Then suddenly, right before dawn broke upon the horizon, two small eyes opened wide beneath heavy lids; bright blue irises stared intently forward against blackness surrounding its owner. Slowly, consciousness returned, bringing along with it feelings of sadness coupled with regret. For now, instead of dreaming happy thoughts about winning games, I found myself reliving painful moments spent watching others succeed while failing miserably myself. These kinds of experiences often left me feeling frustrated, angry, lonely—even depressed at times—but tonight especially, I felt particularly sad knowing full well that tomorrow morning wouldn't bring about change nor improvement regarding my situation whatsoever. Tomorrow promised nothing new except perhaps additional failures piled atop previous ones. Nevertheless, although discouraged, determined never gave up hope completely. There remained always room for optimism somewhere deep within heart and soul regardless of current circumstances prevailing outside self-imposed prison walls erected long ago. Hope allowed belief in possibility beyond reach currently available resources provided opportunity presented itself unexpectedly later down road ahead. Such conviction born solely out trust placed firmly in Almighty Creator, Master Planner behind universe. Without Him, existence devoid meaning altogether. Yet, trusting fully in His infinite wisdom, unfathomable power, boundless goodness, unwavering love, undying mercy enabled continuing onward journey despite seemingly ins

Generating talk titled: Charity Never Faileth
My dear brothers, sisters, and friends throughout the world, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you. Tonight we are meeting in 72 languages across the globe. We have been blessed by messages from our leaders that have touched us deeply as they have spoken about Jesus Christ—His life here upon earth; His atoning sacrifice; His Resurrection from death; His appearances after He rose again; His teachings; His priesthood authority; His Atonement, which makes possible all other blessings; and His continuing role today as our Savior and Redeemer.

As President Russell M. Nelson has said: “Jesus is the center of everything.” And so it should be.

This evening’s theme song speaks powerfully of God’s great plan of happiness:

I know my Father lives! That he loves me … With all his heart. My soul delights To sing his praise. For all things work together In harmony complete. The Lord knows who I am, And where I’m bound.

I know my Father lives!

That he loves me …

With all his heart.

My soul delights

To sing his praise.

For all things work together

In harmony complete.

The Lord knows who I am,

And where I’m bound.

Now, tonight, let each one of us resolve to do more than just think or even say, “I believe,” but rather live according to what we profess to believe—that Heavenly Father lives, that He loves us, and that we can return home to Him someday if we will follow His Son, Jesus Christ.

A few weeks ago, Sister Gong and I were invited to visit a family whose son had recently passed away following an accident. As we entered their house, they greeted us warmly. They told us how much they loved him and expressed gratitude for the peace that comes through faith in Jesus Christ and understanding His Atoning Sacrifice. Their eyes filled with tears when we spoke words of comfort and assurance to them.

They then shared with us something very special—they explained that before leaving for the hospital that day, they went into their basement and found two small bags containing letters written over many years by their son to his mother. These letters contained words of encouragement and expressions of love for her. When she read these precious notes, she felt comforted because she knew her son was watching out for her and would continue to watch over her always.

Later, while driving back home alone, Sister Gong began reflecting on the experience and asked herself, “What could I leave behind that might bless someone else?”

We often hear people use the phrase “pay-it-forward” to describe acts of kindness done without expectation of reward. It means doing good deeds for others simply because they need help, not expecting anything in return. Paying forward includes giving time, talents, and resources to those around us. This kind of selfless generosity shows true charity—the pure love of Christ.

“Charity never faileth”—it endures forever. Charity is defined as “the pure love of Christ.”

President Joseph F. Smith taught, “[It] is the most enduring principle of heaven. … [It] is the greatest thing in mortality. ”

Heavenly Father wants everyone to feel His love and the joy that accompanies it. He sends angels among us to minister unto us—to lift up our burdens, encourage us, strengthen us, console us, teach us, warn us, guide us, heal us, protect us, inspire us, uplift us, edify us—and yes, sometimes correct us.

Each angelic messenger is sent by our loving Heavenly Father and represents both divine justice and mercy. Angels come bearing witness of truth and light, bringing hope and healing to broken hearts and souls. Those who serve as messengers of God are known by different names, including prophets, seers, revelators, apostles, teachers, ministers, disciples, missionaries, elders, priests, deacons, bishops, patriarchs, seventies, high priests, Relief Society presidents, Young Women advisers, Primary workers, seminary instructors, Sunday School teachers, and parents. All of these individuals receive guidance directly from God concerning the needs of the children of God.

Angels bring glad tidings of great joy and promise deliverance from sin and sorrow. Because of Them —because of Them —we are saved, healed, strengthened, lifted, guided, protected, inspired, encouraged, consoled, enlightened, warned, sanctified, purified, redeemed, delivered, resurrected, glorified, exalted, made perfect, crowned, and ultimately returned safely Home to Our Eternal Parents.

Because of Them —because of Them —we have received forgiveness for our sins and transgressions. Because of Them —because of Them —our testimonies grow stronger every day. Because of Them —because of Them —we find purpose and meaning in our lives. Because of Them —because of Them —we learn to love God and neighbor as ourselves. Because
